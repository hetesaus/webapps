				"NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",
				"Sergei K. Krikalev has spent more time in space than anyone else. He has racked up a total of 803 days, 9 hours and 39 minutes, which is equivalent to 2.2 years. He retired from spaceflight in 2007.",
				"Mercury has no atmosphere which means there is no wind or weather.",
				"In China, the Milky Way is known as the silver river. In Japan and Korea silver river means galaxies in general, not just the Milky Way.",
				"Red Dwarf stars that are low in mass can burn continually for up to 10 trillion years.",
				"There is an estimated 2 x 10²³ stars in space. In English, this is: 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.",
				"Scientists used to believe that the same side of Mercury always faced the Sun. However, in 1965 astronomers discovered that the planet rotates three times during every two orbits it makes.",

				"Buzz Lightyear (from Toy Story) has actually been out in space. He has spent 15 months on board the International Space Station, and returned to Earth on the 11th September, 2009.",
				"Light year is a measure of distance, not time. It is the distance that light travels during one Earth year (The speed of light is 300,000km/s, which means that this is a very, tremendously, amazingly huge distance of over 9.5 trillion km).",
				"Astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Sun and the Earth, and it measures 8 light minutes and 19 light seconds, or 149.597 million kilometers in humans-can-achieve-it units.",
				"A unit called parsec is even longer than a light year. Measuring 3.26 light years, it is a function of an astronomical unit and a parallax angle of 1 degree. Its name is derived from parallax of one arcsecond.",

				"The most massive star, and one of the hottest that we know of, is the RMC 136a1, with the mass of 315 Suns and the temperature of over 50000 K. It is just a brisk walk away of 163,000 light-years, sitting in the Large Magellanic cloud.",
				"Galaxies can collide. In fact, our own milky way is due a collision with Andromeda galaxy. Not to worry though, this is going to happen in over 4 billion years from now, and even when it happens, galactic distances are so vast that the chances of a star or a planet hitting each other are almost non-existent.",
				"There are over 100 billion galaxies in the universe, by current estimates made by Hubble space telescope, but that number is probably to rise as we develop better telescope technology.",
				"There are over 300 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. In the observable universe the estimate is that there are 70 billion trillion (7 x 1022) stars.",

				"Galaxies come in different sizes, but also different shapes.",
				"The three main types of galaxies are elliptical, spiral and irregular of which each category has subcategories.",
				"The first spiral galaxy we discovered, besides our own, is the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51). It is estimated to be 23 million years away from the Milky Way.",
				"Measuring distances to galaxies is tricky. We try to find a single star in that galaxy and measure the distance to it.",
				"There are 8 planets in our solar system. In order, from the closest to the Sun to the furthest, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.",
				"For a long time the little, distant Pluto was listed as a planet, but it has its own classification now: a dwarf planet.",
				"The planets are separated into the planets of the inner solar system, and the outer system. There is a huge difference between these planets, both in their size and their composition. The planets of the outer system are known as the giant planets (or Jovian planets), while the inner planets are called the terrestrial planets.",
				"The inner planets are fairly small, with the Earth being the biggest among them. They are pretty dense, with a rocky composition, iron-nickel cores and few or no satellites. Each of these has some sort of surface features, such as impact craters, volcanoes and canyons.",
				"Revolution is what we call one complete circle that a planet makes around the Sun, and rotation is a single full circle around the planet’s axis. Earth’s rotation is what we call a day, and its Revolution is one year.",
				"Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun. It has a year of 88 days, and a day that lasts almost 60 Earth days. On the side that is facing towards the Sun it has a scorching surface temperature of over 700K (423 C), but on the other side it’s surprisingly freezing with temperatures below 0 C.",
				"The reason for this huge temperature difference is because of Mercury’s long day. The dark side is so cold that there are even hints that there might be actual traces of water ice.",
				"Even though the Mercury is the planet nearest to the Sun, Venus is actually the hottest. That is because Venus has an extremely dense carbon-dioxide atmosphere, which creates the strongest green-house effect known to man.",
				"The pressure on the surface of Venus is as high as it is at the depth of 1 kilometer in Earth’s oceans. The temperature is at least 735 K (462 °C), and its surface features look as what we normally think Hell looks like.",
				"The Earth is actually closest to the Sun during January and farthest during July. The seasons we experience are due to the tilt of the Earth’s axis, which makes certain areas get more sunshine at the different parts of its revolution.",
				"Earth’s orbit starts at an altitude of 2000 km. If we were to build a staircase from the sea level to orbit, it would take two weeks to climb.",
				"The only natural satellite that orbits the Earth is Moon. It is one of the largest and densest satellites, but it doesn’t have any atmosphere. The Moon is in synchronous orbit around the Earth, which means that we always see the same side of the Moon.",
				"Distance to the Moon from Earth is 384,402 km (238,856 mi). You could fit all the planets of our system in there, with room to spare.",
				"Moon gravity is 1/6 of Earths. If there was a pool on the Moon, swimmers could jump out of the water like dolphins, launching themselves more than a meter high.",
				"There is no dark side of the Moon. The side that we don’t see is illuminated by the Sun as often as the side that we face.",
				"Every year there are at least 2 lunar (Moon) eclipses, but it can happen that there are no solar eclipses. While the solar eclipses are rare, they still occur at least once every 18 months. The reason why we feel it’s much rarer than that is because they can be seen only from a fairly small area on the Earth.",
				"Lunar eclipse happens when the Moon passes into the Earth’s umbra (shadow), which means that Earth is blocking the sunlight that usually falls on the Moon. This event can happen up to four times per year.",
				"During the lunar eclipse, we still see the Moon, but it has a weak reddish tint. We sometimes call it the Blood Moon.",
				"A Blue Moon is not really blue. It’s just a name for a second full moon that happens in one month, every now and then.",
				"The solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes right in front of the Sun, and it casts its shadow on Earth. The area of Earth that is in the Moon’s shadow is the only part on Earth where that particular eclipse can be seen. This is the only time when we can see the Sun’s corona from the Earth.",
				"Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and it is the second smallest planet in our solar system. It has much weaker gravity than Earth: with the gravity of 38%, a 100 kg person would weight only 38kg on Mars.",
				"The red planet is also known for having some of the most impressive surface features. It is the home of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, and Valles Marineris a vast network of Canyons, second only to the rift valleys on Earth.",
				"Olympus Mons (the largest volcano in the solar system) is almost 22 km high, more than 2.5 times as tall as our highest mountain Mount Everest.",
				"Mars has two tiny moons: Phobos and Deimos. It is believed that these moons are actually asteroids that have been caught up in the Mars’s asteroid field. The names of these satellites mean Fear and Dread, which is very suitable for the companions of the roman god of war.",
				"The outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. These humongous planets are also known as Jovian planets, in honor of Jupiter, the biggest of them. These planets together make up 99% of the mass that is orbiting the Sun.",
				"Jupiter and Saturn are made of primarily hydrogen and helium, while the Uranus and Neptune have more icy components – a reason why these two are often called the ice giants.",
				"Each of the outer planets has rings around it, but only the Saturn’s’ are visible to us from Earth. These rings are composed of small chunks of ice and rock, and they are surprisingly thin (less than a kilometer thick).",
				"If Saturn’s rings were a meter long, they would be 10000 times thinner than a razorblade.",
				"The Saturn has seven distinct rings. It is unknown why these rings are so prominent, but it is believed that it has something to do with the large number of moons that orbit Saturn. The rings have a radius of about 250000 km.",
				"If one was to drive a car on one of the Saturn’s rings, at the speed of 100 km/h, it would take over 14 weeks to finish one lap.",
				"The biggest moon that is orbiting Saturn is Titan. It is the only natural satellite that has dense atmosphere, mostly composed of nitrogen. Due to its low surface temperature of 94 K (−179.2 °C), it has lakes of methane, which makes it the only celestial body that we know of that has surface liquid, besides the Earth.",
				"Jupiter is the biggest planet in our system, over 300 times bigger than Earth. It is so big that it is sometimes considered a failed star. In fact, it emits more energy than it receives from the Sun.",
				"Jupiter has a huge perpetual storm that rages in its upper layers, known as the Great Red Spot. It is so big that the whole Earth could fit into it. Gas giants have a very turbulent atmosphere, so storms such as this are fairly common. True enough, both Neptune and Saturn have their own spots, called the Great Dark Spot and the Great White Spot, respectively.",
				"Jupiter has 67 natural satellites (or moons), the highest number of all the planets in the solar system. The largest and most famous are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.",
				"Pluto is not the only dwarf planet in our system. Besides Pluto there are four other dwarf planets in our system: Ceres, Haumea, Makemake and Eris.",
				"All the dwarf planets, except Ceres, are called the Plutoids in honor of the ex-planet Pluto. This designation is reserved for all the dwarf planets that orbit the Sun beyond Neptune.",
				"The main difference between a planet and a dwarf planet is that the dwarf planets have not cleared their neighborhood. Dwarf planets tend to orbit in zones shared with similar objects that can cross their path around the Sun, such as the asteroids. Dwarf planets are also smaller than the planet Mercury, the smallest planet.",
				"There is an asteroid belt that orbits Sun between Mars and Jupiter. It is believed that these asteroids are remnants of a planet that failed to form during the solar system creation.",
				"Asteroids can vary in size from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers.",
				"Contrary to the movies and popular belief, the asteroid belt is fairly easy to maneuver in a spacecraft. Even though there are over a million asteroids estimated in the belt, they populate such a huge area of space that the distances between individual asteroids are at least several kilometers.",
				"The crown of the asteroid belt is Ceres, recently classified a dwarf planet. Ceres has a radius of around 950km, and strong enough gravity that it pulled itself into a roughly spherical shape, granting it the almost-planet title.",
				"The solar wind is a combination of particles, mostly ionized atoms from the stars corona, and magnetic fields produced by the star. It bathes our planet constantly, and the radiation would be deadly, if we were not protected by Earth’s magnetic field.",
				"The area behind Neptune is called the Kuiper belt. It is a disc shaped region of comets, asteroids and dwarf planets, including Pluto. There are estimated thousands of bodies larger than 100 km and trillions of comets. Even the big bodies are not typical asteroids, but frozen liquids and gasses such as methane, ammonia and water.",
				"Comets are space snowballs, composed of frozen water and gasses, rock and dust. The nucleus of a comet is usually not bigger than 10 km, but as the comet approaches the Sun and the frozen gases begin to evaporate, the nucleus can expand to over 80 000km.",
				"The tail of a comet appears when it gets close enough to Sun and starts to melt. It is caused by the radiation pressure from the Sun which blows away some of the matter from the evaporating comet nucleus, which is why the tail always faces away from the Sun. These tails can be even millions of kilometers long.",
				"The earliest recorded comet is the Halley comet, which was first observed in ancient china in 240 B. C. It makes one orbit around the Sun every 75 years.",
				"Exoplanets are the planets we found that are outside our solar system. These extrasolar planets are very hard to detect, and only in the past 10 years or so have we been able to regularly find new ones. We have so far discovered over 2000 exoplanets.",
				"The smallest recorded exoplanet is twice the size of the Moon, while the most massive has almost 30 times the mass of Jupiter. This gas giant is so big that is uncertain whether it’s a planet, or a brown dwarf (the smallest type of a star).",
				"Every black hole contains a universe. Our universe might just exist inside of a black hole.",
				"Black holes can slow down time, hypothetically making time travel possible.",
				"Black holes are considered the single most deadly force in the entire universe.",
				"The largest black hole we've discovered is 12 billion times larger than earth's sun.",
				"The super massive black hole burns 429 trillion times brighter than our sun.",
				"The smallest black hole we've found can rip winds out at 20 million miles per hour.",
				"A black hole is created when a stars center implodes on itself, it creates a supernova. That supernova is a huge explosion that blasts into outer space, creating a massive pull so intense that even light can't get out.",
				"Saturn's moon Titan has plenty of evidence of organic (life) chemicals in its atmosphere.",
				"Life is known to exist only on Earth, but in 1986 NASA found what they thought might be fossils of microscopic living things in a rock from Mars.",
				"Most scientists say life's basic chemicals formed on the Earth. The astronomer Fred Hoyle said they came from space.",
				"Oxygen is circulated around the helmet in space suits in order to prevent the visor from misting.",
				"The middle layers of space suits are blown up like a balloon to press against the astronaut's body. Without this pressure, the astronaut's body would boil!",
				"The gloves included in the space suit have silicon rubber fingertips which allow the astronaut some sense of touch.",
				"The full cost of a spacesuit is about $11 million although 70% of this is for the backpack and the control module.",
				"Ever wondered how the pull of gravity is calculated between heavenly bodies? It's simple. Just multiply their masses together, and then divide the total by the square of the distance between them.",
				"Glowing nebulae are named so because they give off a dim, red light, as the hydrogen gas in them is heated by radiation from the nearby stars.",
				"The Drake Equation was proposed by astronomer Frank Drake to work out how many civilizations there could be in our galaxy - and the figure is in millions.",
				"SETI is the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence - the program that analyzes radio signals from space for signs of intelligent life.",
				"The Milky Way galaxy we live in: is one among the BILLIONS in space.",
				"The Milky Way galaxy is whirling rapidly, spinning our sun and all its other stars at around 100 million km per hour.",
				"The Sun travels around the galaxy once every 200 million years – a journey of 100,000 light years.",
				"There may be a huge black hole in the very middle of the most of the galaxies.",
				"The Universe is probably about 15 billion years old, but the estimations vary.",
				"One problem with working out the age of the Universe is that there are stars in our galaxy which are thought to be 14 to 18 billion years old – older than the estimated age of the Universe. So, either the stars must be younger, or the Universe older.",
				"The very furthest galaxies are spreading away from us at more than 90% of the speed of light.",
				"The Universe was once thought to be everything that could ever exist, but recent theories about inflation (e.g. Big Bang) suggest our universe may be just one of countless bubbles of space time.",
				"The Universe may have neither a centre nor an edge, because according to Einstein’s theory of relativity, gravity bends all of space time around into an endless curve.",
				"If you fell into a black hole, you would stretch like spaghetti.",
				"Matter spiraling into a black hole is torn apart and glows so brightly that it creates the brightest objects in the Universe – quasars.",
				"The swirling gases around a black hole turn it into an electrical generator, making it spout jets of electricity billions of kilometers out into space.",
				"The opposite of black holes are estimated to be white holes which spray out matter and light like fountains.",
				"A day in Mercury lasts approximately as long as 59 days on earth.",
				"Twice during Mercury’s orbit, it gets so close to the Sun and speeds so much that the Sun seems to go backwards in the sky.",
				"Nicolaus Copernicus was the astronomer who first suggested that the Sun was the centre, and that the Earth went round the sun.",
				"The ideas of Copernicus came not from looking at the night sky, but from studying ancient astronomy.",
				"As the earth turns, the stars come back to the same place in the night sky every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds. This is a sidereal day (star day).",
				"When Neil Armstrong stepped on the Moon for the first time, he said these famous words: That’s one small step for a man; one giant leap for mankind.",
				"From the moon, astronauts brought back 380 kg of Moon rock.",
				"During the moon landing, a mirror was left on the Moon’s surface to reflect a laser beam which measured the Moon’s distance from the Earth with amazing accuracy.",
				"The stars in each constellation are named after a Greek alphabet.",
				"The brightest star in each constellation is called the Alpha Star, the next brightest Beta, and so on.",
				"The distance to the planets is measured by bouncing radar signals off them and timing how long the signals take to get there and back.",
				"Spacecrafts have double hulls (outer coverings) which protect them against other space objects that crash into them.",
				"Manned Spacecrafts have life support systems that provide oxygen to breathe, usually mixed with nitrogen (as in ordinary air). Charcoal filters out smells.",
				"Spacecrafts toilets have to get rid of waste in low gravity conditions, Astronauts have to sit on a device which sucks away the waste. Solid waste is dried and dumped in space, but the water is saved.",
				"A comet’s tail is made as it nears the Sun and begins to melt. A vast plume of gas millions of kilometers across is blown out behind by the solar wind. The tail is what you see, shining as the sunlight catches it.",
				"The Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet smashed into Jupiter in July 1994, with the biggest crash ever witnessed.",
